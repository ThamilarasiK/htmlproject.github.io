        <p>A bakery is an establishment that produces and sells flour-based baked goods made in an oven such as bread,<br> cookies, cakes, doughnuts, bagels, pastries, and pies.[1] Some retail <br>bakeries are also categorized as cafés, serving coffee and tea to customers who wish to consume the baked goods on the premises. <br> In some countries, a distinction is made between bakeries, which primarily sell breads, and pâtisseries, which primarily sell sweet baked goods.</p>

     Some bakeries provide services for special occasions (such as weddings, <br>anniversaries, birthday parties, business networking events, etc.) or customized baked products for people who have allergies or sensitivities to certain <br>foods (such as nuts, peanuts, dairy or gluten, etc.). Bakeries can provide a wide range of cake designs such as sheet cakes, layer cakes, wedding cakes, tiered cakes, etc. <br>Other bakeries may specialize in traditional or hand-made types of baked products made with locally milled flour, without flour bleaching agents or flour treatment agents, baking what is sometimes referred to as artisan bread
